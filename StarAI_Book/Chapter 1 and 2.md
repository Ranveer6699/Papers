Somethings which I would like clarified. <br>

"These approaches make what can be seen as a single-table single-row
assumption, which requires that each instance is described in a single row by a fixed set of features
and all instances are independent of one another (given the model)."
<br>
I understand how these apply to classification methods such as regression and SVMs, but I am not sure why it also applies to Bayesian Networks
<br>
Some clarification on HErbrand clauses would be appreciated


I have clarified for the most part. More reading would also help
